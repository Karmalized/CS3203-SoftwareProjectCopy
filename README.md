buildNutrientFile.java: Adapts input2txt.cpp into an optimized Java environment with functions taking system input for nutrients and building upon values until a full day has elapsed (and the file information is exported into a database)

Water.java: Adapts Water.h into an optimized Java environment using functions that keeps track of water consumption and the total amount of intake from the user against recommended values

BMI/BMRCalculator.java & DeficiencyCalculator.java: adapts the cpp files of the same name in a java environment

Micros.java: function call to USDA database of vitamins and their levels onto a nutrientMap

USDAapi.java: API calls to the USDA database
